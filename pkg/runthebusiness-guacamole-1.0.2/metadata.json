  "description": "guacamole\n\nThis class installs and configures guacamole\n\nAfter installing you will still need to run: tightvncserver from command line and set up it's password before guacamole can be used -- we could not find a way to automate this part of the process.\n\nExamples:\n\n\tguacamole{\"installguacamole\":\n\t  password=>'examplepassword'\n\t}\n\n\nThis module has been tested in debian squeeze. The init.pp and params.pp files have place-holders for the functionality to include other flavors. If you would like to contribute the code to enable these other flavors please let us know.\n\nAuthors\n-------\nWill Ferrer, Ethan Brooks\n\nLicensees\n-------\n2012 developed under license for Switchsoft LLC http://www.switchsoft.com a \"Direct response telephony company\" as part of it's \"VOIP Call distribution, ROI analysis platform, call recording, and IVR for inbound and outbound sales\" and Run the Business Systems LLC a \"Technology development investment group\" as part of it's \"PHP, Javascript rapid application development framework and MySQL analysis tools\"\n\nLicense\n-------\nLicensed under the terms of the Open Source LGPL 3.0 license.  \n\n\nContact\n-------\nwill.ferrer@runthebusiness.net\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nPlease send tickets and issues to our contact email address or at: https://github.com/runthebusiness/puppet-guacamole/issues\n\nProject Url\n-------\nhttps://github.com/runthebusiness/puppet-guacamole\n",
